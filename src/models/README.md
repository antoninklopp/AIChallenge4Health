## All machine learning models

This folder contains all the machine learning that will be created during this challenge.  
Every model shoudl derive from the abstract class **AbstractModel**  and implement 
the required method. 

Once the model is created, the user should add this model in the **tests/test_model_validity.py** test 
class for it to be tracked by travis.
